# Singularity-Method-Cluster-Electrostatic-Simulations
A simple kinetic algorithm to create Reaction-Limited-Cluster-Aggregates (RLCA) of charged particles and simulate their electrostatic double-layer utilizing the Singularity Method. Constant potential and constant charge as surface charge regulation models can be used.
